A custom text object for selecting quoted text. It depends on awesome Kana's https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user. 


vim-textobj-quoted gives you two new text-objects: 

* iq
That stands for Inner Quoted
* *_aq_*
That stands for Around Quoted

So, the two text-objects defined will work with the following quoting chars:

* { }
* " "
* ' '
* ( )

Please note that the defined text-objects are single-line oriented. I find them very useful in situations like the following (* indicated cursor position): 

* "some awes*ome text"
* (some awes*ome text)
* {some awes*ome text}
* 'some awes*ome text'

In each case you could use commands like viq or ciq and select/cancel all the quoted text. Obviously, you can achive the same results using commands like vi" or vi{. Indeed, the real benefit you'll get using this plugin is that you will have to remember only the q char.
